NGS-based metagenomic pathogen viruses and bacteria identification system
# Description
Most of methods of microbial diagnostics take significant amount of time. Also, they render themselves useless in the case of unculturable forms of pathogen agents. It is proposed to use Illumina sequencing of mixed samples to improve the identification of infectious agents.
# Goal
Build an Illumina sequencing-based pathogen agents identification system
# Targets
- Download and organize reference sequences of viruses and bacteria.
- State pathogenicity group (BCL-like) for each tax_id and sequence.
- Set up the pipeline for mixed sample pathogen agents identification, assemble and annotation.
